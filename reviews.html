                 <p class="reviewcontent">"Caroline is an excellent, capable, caring dog sitter -- She stayed in my home for around five days with my two dogs and performed above and beyond the call of duty. One of my dogs is epileptic and had a seizure during her stay -- she handled it like a pro and I was grateful that she was there (it can be very frightening). Communication skills are excellent and the house was as clean as I left it. Highly recommend!"</p>

                <p class="reviewcontent">"Caroline was amazing! Our pup has separation anxiety and we weren’t sure how he would do with us away for a week.  Our pup warmed up to her pretty quickly and we could tell from the daily picture updates that he was in good hands. Caroline was super accommodating, respectful of our home, and most importantly, genuinely excited to hang with our pup. Thank you Caroline! We look forward to booking you again soon!"</p>

                <p class="reviewcontent">"We are SO happy we chose Caroline to watch our cat while we were out of town! You can tell right away that she truly loves animals and her sweet, personable nature made us feel very comfortable while we were away. She even left us an adorable welcome home note from our cat, Huck! We will absolutely be using her services in the future!"</p>

                <p class="reviewcontent">"Caroline stayed at our home for 2 nights with our 1 y/o energetic pup recently and we had the BEST experience with her.The entire weekend was full of update texts, photos, and check-ins which we LOVED. We never once worried about our pup and knew he was in the best hands.  We 100% recommend Caroline to anyone looking and will absolutely utilize her services ourselves in the future. Thank you Caroline!"</p>

                <p class="reviewcontent">"Caroline was amazing, we hadn’t left the pets for a while and was so nice to have some so caring to look after our cat and pup. She was great at sending updates and pictures to let us know how much fun they were having and left us some super cute notes for when we arrived home from our travel. Will definitely look forward to having Caroline look after them again!"</p>

                <p class="reviewcontent">"Caroline was awesome! Nice, mature, and professional...followed our instructions to the letter. We were very nervous being gone for a week and had her stay at the house. She will be our 1st choice in the future. Not only did she take great care for our dogs, our 3 month old golden retriever pup needed medication during our week long trip; rash and infection were gone when we returned. She responded to our texts promptly and sent pictures throughout the week. We highly recommend!!!"</p>
