                <h3>Hi there! <br>My Name is Caroline!</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I have been a lover of animals my entire life. Growing up, my family always had pets ranging from dogs to cats to fish. At one point, my family had 7 dogs and 8 cats! People thought we were crazy, but our pets were part of the family. I really miss having animals around (my apartment does not allow pets), but I realized I could use my experience with animals to help take care of other people's pets. I feel completely comfortable staying with young or old pets, administering medicine,and/or driving animals to and from daycare. I hope to make your time away from your pet(s) as worry-free as possible! I look forward to working with you and your pets!</p>
